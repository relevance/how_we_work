This site describes how Relevance and our partners build software together.
People we encounter often want to know more about how we work.
Potential customers want to know what they'll be getting.
New [customers](http://thinkrelevance.com/clients) want to know how to work smoothly with us.
Potential employees and partners have similar goals.
And people who read our [blogs](http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/),
hear us [speak at conferences](http://thinkrelevance.com/events),
and attend our [training classes](http://thinkrelevance.com/training)
often ask for more information about how we do things.
This site is intended as an aid in answering those questions.
It's also good for us to be explicit about what we do.

One size does not fit all,
and individual projects will vary from this description as teams discover their own rhythm.
This site should be seen as a description of how we work,
rather than as a *prescription* for how we must work.
(At the same time, we do work to keep the site current, so that it is an *accurate* description.)

If you have an idea that you want to turn into working software, or if you've already decided
to work with us on a project, you should start by reading
[the stakeholder view][stakeholder_narrative].
That page describes how our way of working looks and feels to our customers.

If you think you may want to work here,
or if you're joining our team (whether permanently or temporarily), you should start with
[the developer view][developer_narrative].
That page explains how we work from a developer's perspective,
and goes into more day-to-day details.

In either case, though, please don't restrict yourself to the view you start with.
Customers will benefit from having some understanding of how the everyday development works.
And it's vitally important that developers, designers, testers, and project managers understand
the customer perspective on everything we do.
So *start* with the view that matches your primary role, but you will find the other view valuable as well.

(If you already have a familiarity with agile software development methods,
you can quickly get an overview of how we work by starting with
[our take on agile software development][agilists].
Or if you're wondering about the whys and wherefores of this website
explaining how we work, you can read about our [motivation][why].)
