# This site describes how we build software

We make mistakes.  From those mistakes we learn and adapt.  This site describes the process we've developed from our experiences.

As such, this site is a description of how we work,
rather than a *prescription* for how we must work.
We keep the site current so that it is an *accurate* description.
Individual projects vary from this description to match its unique context.
