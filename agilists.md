# Relevance's Perspective on Agile Methods

"Agile" means many different things to different people.
At Relevance, there are two primary lenses through which we view and understand agile methods:
the Agile Manifesto, and the concept of nested feedback loops.
This page explains how we work as seen through those two lenses.
