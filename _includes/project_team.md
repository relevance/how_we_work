### Project Team {#project_team}

The two most important roles on any project are the [project sponsor][] and [project manager][].
The project sponsor owns the vision for the project, choosing priorities and accepting completed work.
The project manager makes sure the process is followed, keeps the team communicating, and removes obstacles to the team's success.
