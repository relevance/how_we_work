### Project Sponsor {#project_sponsor}

Within the customer organization, there may be many stakeholders.
And conflicting priorities for the project are natural in such a situation.
Those conflicts and discussions are best handled by the customer.
To improve communication and keep development moving ahead with clear priorities,
we ask each of our customers to name a "project sponsor."
That sponsor is the primary point of contact for Relevance.
The sponsor has the final say about task priorities, clarifying requirements, and other decisions that belong to the customer.

None of that is to say that the sponsor is the *only* point of contact.
Other stakeholders are welcome to attend daily standup meetings,
and their perspective on issues is crucial.
Part of the project sponsor's responsibility is to hold off development of features
where there is serious debate among stakeholders about how the feature should work.
