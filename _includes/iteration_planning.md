### Iteration Planning {#iteration_planning}

At the beginning of each iteration, we engage in a planning exercise with the
[project sponsor][] and other interested customer representatives.
The [story cards][] that are to be the focus of the new iteration are
chosen from the pool of cards remaining.

As part of this exercise, Relevance provides initial estimates of how much work we think
is involved in each card, in [points][].
The customer's role is to assign priorities to the cards, and then to choose the cards that
should be worked on during the next two-week iteration.
