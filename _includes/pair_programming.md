## Pair Programming {#pair_programming}

Pair programming involves two programmers at a single computer
(each with a monitor and keyboard of their own) working together on a single task.
As a unit, they maintain a high level of quality as well as ensuring a broad perspective on problem solving.
Pair programming drastically reduces defects and helps ensure that code experiences a minimum amount of rewriting.
(See the studies referenced at [the wikipedia entry on Pair Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_Programming#Scientific_studies)).

Pair programming reduces the overall cost of development and maintenance.

At Relevance, the majority of development happens with a pair of programmers engaged on the task simultaneously.
At the [discretion][] of the project team, specific coding tasks may be performed solo.
When this happens, the code must pass [code review][] before moving on to [qa][].
