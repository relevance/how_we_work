## Open-Source Fridays {#open_source_fridays}

On Fridays at Relevance, we don't do billable client work.
"Open-Source Fridays" are for things that improve our lives as developers,
and for giving back to the rich sea of open-source software (especially development tools)
in which our business swims and thrives.

Each of us as Relevance has one or two open-source projects we're involved in;
some of them are our own, created and primarily maintained here at Relevance.
Others began elsewhere, and we pitch in with help and improvements.
Here are some examples:

* [Tarantula](http://github.com/relevance/tarantula)
* [Blue Ridge](http://github.com/relevance/blue-ridge)
* [Micronaut](http://github.com/spicycode/micronaut)
* [Castronaut](http://github.com/relevance/castronaut)
* [Log Buddy](http://github.com/relevance/log_buddy)
* [Cap Gun](http://github.com/relevance/cap_gun)
* [Vasco](http://github.com/relevance/vasco)
* [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
