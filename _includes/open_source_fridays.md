## Open-Source Fridays {#open_source_fridays}

On Fridays at Relevance, we don't do billable client work.
"Open-Source Fridays" are for things that improve our lives as developers,
and for giving back to the rich sea of open-source software (especially development tools)
in which our business swims and thrives.

Each of us at Relevance has open-source projects we're involved in;
some of them are our own, created and primarily maintained here at Relevance.
Others began elsewhere, and we pitch in with help and improvements.
Here are some examples:

* [Clojure](http://clojure.com)
* [RSpec](http://github.com/rspec/)
* [Incanter](http://github.com/liebke/incanter/wiki)
* [PDFKit](http://github.com/jdpace/pdfkit)
* [Functional Koans](http://github.com/relevance/functional-koans)
* [LazyTest](http://github.com/stuartsierra/lazytest)
* [Errbit](http://github.com/jdpace/errbit)
* [New World Order](http://github.com/relevance/new-world-order)
* [Nachos](http://github.com/rsanheim/nachos)
* [Log Buddy](http://github.com/relevance/log_buddy)
* [Cap Gun](http://github.com/relevance/cap_gun)
