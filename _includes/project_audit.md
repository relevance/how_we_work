### Project Audit {#project_audit}

A project audit is wide-ranging, and can cover any area of the software development lifecycle. A typical audit will cover the following areas:

* Development process: Story tracking, repository management, code hygiene, iteration planning, and defect tracking.
* Testing: Unit testing, functional testing, acceptance testing, continuous integration, and test coverage.
* Data: Database design, sample data, query design, and migration management.
* Code: MVC adherence, object modeling, idiomatic language and library usage, and transactional integrity.
* Deployment: Server setup, monitoring, and log management.

We generally fix a number of issues during the audit. At the end of an audit, the project team receives a detailed report describing these fixes. The report will also cover the areas listed above, rating the project's performance to date and providing suggestions for improvement.
