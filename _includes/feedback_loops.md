## Nested Feedback Loops {#feedback_loops}

We believe that software projects are dominated by change: changing requirements, changing environments, changing interactions with other systems, and changing user communities.

[Glenn's](http://thinkrelevance.com/team/glenn-vanderburg) paper,
[Extreme Programming Annealed][xpannealed], explains the structure and workings
of agile methods in terms of nested, time- and scale-defined feedback loops.
We think that's a great way to understand how agile processes work,
and how to tailor them to particular situations.

In order to respond quickly to change, our process includes the following feedback loops.
These feedback loops operate on different time scales to facilitate everything from tiny adjustments to wholesale changes in a project's direction.

| Feedback Loop                             | Frequency             | Participants                      | Length
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------

| [Daily Standup][]                         | Daily                 | [Project team][]                  | 15 minutes
| [PM Buddy Session][pm_buddy]              | Weekly                | [Project manager][], [PM Buddy][] | 30 minutes
