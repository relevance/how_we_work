## Relevance's Approach in a Nutshell {#philosophy}

There are two big risks in software development.
The first, and most obvious, is not getting the thing done.
The second is building the wrong thing.

One way to avoid the second problem is to postpone doing anything
until you're sure you know what's desired.
But that really courts the first risk: not delivering anything.

At Relevance, we take a different approach, that can be summed up in three simple rules:

1. We are determined to deliver new business value every single day of the project.
2. We ask our customers to give us feedback on everything we do,
   as soon as possible after we do it.
   Making adjustments costs very little if we can do it right away.
3. We want to improve continuously.
   We ask both ourselves and our customers to do things just a little bit better every day.
