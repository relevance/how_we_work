### The Daily Standup {#daily_standup}

Every project has a daily standup meeting.
It's scheduled for the same time every day.
Participants from Relevance include the project manager and developers who are currently involved in the project.
From the customer, at least the [project sponsor][] is present; others may be involved if they find the meeting useful.

The meeting covers what each participant or pair accomplished during the previous day,
and what they plan to work on today.
This may seem a little mundane, but with small teams it doesn't take much time, and it is very useful.

* It focuses on *accomplishment*, providing an incentive for everyone to have something to show for every day.
* It keeps everyone in the team aware of what is going on.
* It provides an opportunity to chime in if someone else on the project plans to work on something that you have some insight into.

Before the meeting concludes, there is a chance to raise "blockers":
any situation that keeps a project member from making progress.
Plans are made to address the blockers, to keep everyone moving.

We try to keep the standup meetings short.
15 minutes is the goal.
Occasionally they may run slightly long, but topics that require extended discussion will become the subject of a more focused meeting.
