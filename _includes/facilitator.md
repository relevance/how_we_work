### Facilitator {#facilitator}

Too often, in important meetings, the manager or someone else with a vested interest
in the meeting's result also runs the meeting.
We have found that this can lead to lower participation and morale---essentially a wasted meeting.

Some project meetings are best run by a neutral party who is not a regular member of the
[project team][].
A facilitator acts in this neutral role, focusing on the mechanics of the meeting itself.
In addition, a facilitator can provide outside counsel,
calling the team's beliefs into question to prevent "groupthink".

Like [QA][], the facilitator role is transient; for each meeting that requires a facilitator,
someone from another Relevance team will volunteer to be the facilitator.
(Several Relevance employees have focused on learning the facilitator role,
and have a lot of experience at doing it well.)
