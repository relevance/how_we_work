Agile teams need to accept change and deal with it effectively.
An important tool we use to ensure that we are aware of change
and responding to it is a monthly retrospective.

A retrospective is a meeting with a specific goal in mind:
to make everyone's perspective explicit, inspect results, and come up with specific actions to improve or respond to changes, whether those changes come from outside the team or from within.
We've had a variety of process and technical improvements that have come about due to retrospectives:

* Changing the direction of a project, based on discovering that client budgets have changed.
* Increased transparency with client developers.
* Deciding to implement alternative architectures based on newly revealed (or newly decided) future plans.
* Introducing [PM buddy sessions][pm_buddy], [technical debt management][technical_debt] and [risk management][risk_assessments] across projects.

We do our own company-wide retrospectives periodically,
but we do project-specific retrospectives as well.
Stakeholder involvement is crucial for the project retrospectives.
Discussing what's working well and where things can be improved
is an important part of ensuring that the next iterations are
improved relative to the iterations that have been completed.
