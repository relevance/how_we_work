### Risk Assessments {#risk_assessments}

The projects we do are full of risk: our clients come to us because they're going into unchartered territory, exploring new lines of business.
We know how to [write code][developer], but what we take special pride in is our awareness of risk and ability to handle it.
Many of our practices deal with risk in an implicit way,
but risk assessments are focused solely on risk.

Risk assessments are monthly meetings we have to discover, communicate, track and address risks.
In a risk assessment we:

1. Revisit the status of previous risks.
1. Identify risks using various approaches (including brainstorming, analogy and history-based).
   Each risk has attributes including a name, a description, a consequence in estimated cost and probability.
1. Validate and analyze risks for relevance, ambiguity, and uniqueness.
1. Rank the risks that the project faces.
1. Decide on how we are going to respond to each risk.
   (Valid responses include avoidance, acceptance, monitoring or mitigation.)
