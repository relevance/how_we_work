## Code Coverage {#code_coverage}

Code coverage has many definitions, but it normally represents the percentage of lines (or branches) in a software project that are covered by automated tests. A low score probably means bad code, but a high score doesn't necessarily mean good code!

Relevance has been an industry leader in using code coverage. On some projects, we have insisted on 100% code coverage, even to the point of having the [continuous integration][] build *fail* if coverage slips.

At the start of a project, the project team can choose what code coverage standard to enforce. There are many subtleties here: see our [series][failwith100] of essays and conference talks for a more in-depth discussion of using code coverage on projects.
