### Discretion of the Project Team {#discretion}

No two projects are alike, and no project follows a documented process exactly.
But the team has some discretion.
The *team* (not the individual) has the freedom to vary from any specific practice.
On each project, the [project manager][] is responsible for making sure the teams knows and understands the process for that individual project.

Of course, this is kept simple and lightweight.
The various [feedback loops][] can be used to introduce, discuss, and adopt new processes.
