### Stakeholder {#stakeholder}

A "stakeholder" is anyone who has an interest in the completed project.
Obviously, in a broad sense, that includes us at Relevance and potential end users of the finished project.
But we use the term in a slightly more restricted sense.
Stakeholders are members of the customer organization who will be involved in specifying and accepting the software;
in other words, those who are most interested in using the system to accomplish business or organizational goals.

Stakeholders are those who participate in any of these activities:

* making the decision to engage Relevance for a project
* specifying requirements; writing story cards
* participating in iteration planning meetings; setting priorities
* participating in daily standup meetings
* accepting tasks as completed
* answering questions from the development team to clarify requirements or priorities
