### Developer {#developer}

The developer writes code. At Relevance, we do not call out separate "design" or "architect" roles. Developers architect, and architects code.

Developers employ the following practices:

* [pair programming][]
* [tdd and bdd][]
* [code review][]
* [objective acceptance criteria][]
* [continuous integration][]
* [code coverage analysis][code_coverage]
* [distributed source control][]
* [audits][]
