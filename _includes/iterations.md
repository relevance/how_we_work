### Iterations {#iterations}

Relevance projects are structured in two-week iterations.
For each iteration, a set of [story cards][] is selected that we believe can
be developed during the two weeks.
Then, during the [eight days][open_source_fridays] of the iteration, those cards will be developed methodically,
according to the priorities selected by the [project sponsor][].

As the cards are developed and [showcased][staging] for the customer, they are accepted by the sponsor.
At the end of the iteration (and possibly during the iteration if it will not be too disruptive),
the new features will be deployed to production.
Finally, if the customer has more requirements and wants to continue the project,
[the next iteration is planned][iteration_planning].

Why are our iterations two weeks long?
We've tried other things, and two-week iterations definitely work best for us.
Four weeks is too long, because we can deliver a lot of value in two weeks.
It's just courting risk to wait for the feedback.
One week, on the other hand, is too short.
[Project sponsors][project_sponsor] have trouble accepting
[cards][story_cards] fast enough to keep up,
and the iteration overhead takes up too large a fraction of available development time.
(For certain kinds of projects we have done one-week iterations,
but that's something we'll evaluate carefully with the customer before we choose that route.)
