## Distributed Source Control {#distributed_source_control}

Relevance uses a distributed source control system called Git (and [Github](http://github.com)) to store and track source code and other development-related artifacts.

This is more important than it may first appear. Traditional, centralized source control systems inhibit agile teams by making branch and merge operations expensive. This makes parallel, distributed development more costly. So much so, in fact, that source control can become a bottleneck on overall productivity of the team.

As mentioned elsewhere,
[technology can't solve social problems][tools_and_practices].
But that doesn't mean they can't help.
Git's open, distributed nature has numerous benefits for the way we work:

* It eliminates many barriers to productivity
* It allows us to work with all of our usual tools even when we have to be off the network (such as when traveling)
* It makes it safe to experiment, allowing us to simply try interesting ideas rather than wasting time in analysis paralysis

This excellent talk from Google's I/O conference in 2009,
[The Myth of the Genius Programmer](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/MythGeniusProgrammer.html),
is a great introduction to the ways tools (and the way they're configured)
can encourage or discourage certain types of behavior within and between software teams.
