### Project Manager {#project_manager}

The project manager is a Relevance employee who is responsible for ensuring
that the project continues to move forward toward the goal.
The project manager will schedule most of the necessary meetings and
(except where a facilitator is involved) prepare any documents that should result from those meetings.

The project manager should be watching for potential issues, including
changing customer goals, technical gotchas, personnel scheduling challenges,
business analysis lagging behind development capacity,
and other things that could result in delays or misunderstandings.
Resolution of those issues in a timely manner is the primary responsibility
of the project manager.
