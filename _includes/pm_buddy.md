PM Buddy sessions are weekly meetings to help the project manager stay on top of issues
related to people and process.
(The technical issues are addressed separately during [technical debt assessments][technical_debt].)
Indeed, an observer may think they're witnessing a therapy session.

During the session, the project manager expresses any concerns,
to the PM Buddy and together they plan actions necessary to address them.
When there are no known concerns,
the PM Buddy's job is to be skeptical, probing to uncover the issues that may be
lurking behind the project manager's blind spots.

Some specific examples of improvements we've seen thanks to the PM Buddy sessions:

* Adjusting staffing on projects to create a suitable balance of business analysis and development.
* Questioning established deadlines and encouraging the team to adjust plans on an ongoing basis.
