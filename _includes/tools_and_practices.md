## Tools and Practices {#tools_and_practices}

Tools don't solve your problems; people do.
Tools just help.
It's crucial to choose the right *practices* to go with your tools---the right ways to use your tools so that they do the most for you.

In retrospectives, and day-to-day as required, we discuss how our tools are helping or hurting us,
and how they can work better for us.
When things aren't working quite right, we'll first try to look at the way we're using the tool;
changing our practices is less costly and disruptive than changing a tool.
But we occasionally change the tool as well.

This may sound like a lot of talking and navel-gazing, but our other practices help to keep it lightweight and efficient.
[Pairs][pair_programming] work out a good way of using a new tool together,
and then propagate that knowledge to the rest of the team as they regroup to pair with others,
during [daily standups][daily_standup] and [retrospectives][].
There are also plenty of opportunities to communicate the practice to other project teams within Relevance.
