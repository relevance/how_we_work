## Audits {#audits}

We regularly audit projects, bringing an outsider viewpoint to focus on a specific area of project quality. Audits are not just for other people's work! We audit our own projects during development, using an auditor who is not regularly involved with the project. The most common types of audits are:

* security audit
* performance audit
* project audit
* technical debt audit
