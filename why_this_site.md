# Why This Site?

Every company should have a written description of how they do what they do.
Of course, you shouldn't
[take that too far](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000 "Quality Through Deforestation"),
but writing down your way of working has several benefits:

* It helps you think carefully about what you do and why, and whether it's really justified;
* It prompts you to *notice* anomalies and varations, and think about why they exist;
* If you are serious about keeping the written description accurate, it forces you to be *intentional* about changes to your process.

Additionally, people often ask us about the way we work, and want to know more about it.
That includes current and prospective [customers](http://thinkrelevance.com/clients),
employees, and [students](http://thinkrelevance.com/training).

We built this site for ourselves, so that we could learn and improve
through the process of documenting what we do, and how we do it.
And we built it for those who are interested in how we work,
so that we will have a useful resource to point them to.

We're steeped in the agile and open-source cultures,
so we believe in openness as well as "release early, release often".
As we were writing down the way we work, we couldn't think of any reason we shouldn't make
this document public, even though it's still at an early stage.
So here it is.
