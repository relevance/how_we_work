# Why This Site?

Every company should have a written description of how they do what they do.
Of course, you shouldn't
[take that too far](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000).
Documenting the way you work has several benefits:

* It helps you think carefully about what you do and why and whether it's really justified
* It prompts you to *notice* anomalies and variations and think about why they exist
* It encourages you to be *intentional* about changes to your process

Additionally, people often ask us about the way we work, and want to know more about it.
That includes current and prospective [customers](http://thinkrelevance.com/clients),
employees, and [students](http://thinkrelevance.com/training).

We built this site for ourselves, so that we could learn and improve
through the process of documenting what we do, and how we do it.
And we built it for those who are interested in how we work,
so that we will have a resource to point them to.

We believe in openness and in "release early, release often".
As we put the site together we couldn't think of any reason not to make
it public even though it's still at an early stage.  Feel free to read it and write your own.
